// This lets users upload a picture from their photo library. It currently does not have functionality to take a picture with the camera yet
//BING: I made this from 2 tutorials: one that shows how to make ImageViews tappable (all the stuff having to do with GestureRecognizer) and one that lets users upload photos (all the ImagePickerController stuff)
//BING: Also not sure if we decided to go with multiple profile pics, but the one I setup only has one. I named it imageView1 in case we wanted to add more so we can just do imageView2, etc.
